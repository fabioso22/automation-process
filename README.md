The goal of this project is to create a process that can extract sales data from different sources, including Excel spreadsheets and CSV files, and then merge the data to provide a comprehensive overview of sales across different stores. The data is then analyzed using various indicators, and targets are set for each store based on these indicators.

The project has the following features:

1. Data Import: The project uses Pandas to import sales data from different sources, including Excel spreadsheets and CSV files.

2. Data Integration: The project merges the sales data from different sources into a single data frame using the Pandas library.

3. Data Backup: The project creates a backup of the sales data for each store in a designated folder using the Pathlib library.

4. Data Analysis: The project calculates various indicators for each store, including daily and yearly revenue, product diversity, and average ticket price.

5. Target Setting: Based on the indicators, the project sets targets for each store, including daily and yearly revenue targets, product diversity targets, and average ticket price targets.

The project is useful for any company looking to automate their sales data entry and analysis processes. By automating the process, the company can save time and improve the accuracy of their sales data. Additionally, the project provides a comprehensive overview of sales data, allowing the company to make informed decisions about their business strategies.
